🔥 Cold Outreach Case Study: 32 Qualified Speakers Booked for Faith-Based Virtual Summit
🧑‍💼 Client

Sharon Jackson, Host of the “Faith, Wealth & Love” Virtual Summit (September 2025)
Industry: Faith-based entrepreneurship, women empowerment

❌ The Challenge

Client urgently needed 21 qualified speakers for an upcoming online summit within 4 weeks.

Had no existing speaker list, outreach system, or idea that cold email could deliver real results.

Wanted high-quality, faith-aligned thought leaders — not random signups.

✅ My Solution

I executed a targeted cold outreach campaign combining smart automation with manual personalization.

Key Steps:

Scraped & enriched 793+ speaker leads (authors, coaches, podcasters).

Wrote and launched a 6-email cold sequence (value-driven, personalized).

Managed the campaign through Instantly.ai.

Personally handled warm replies & follow-ups to build trust.

⚙️ Tools Used

Instantly.ai – Campaign management

Manual scraping & Google Sheets – Lead sourcing

ChatGPT & Custom Copywriting – Email content

LinkedIn (secondary outreach) – Added touchpoint
