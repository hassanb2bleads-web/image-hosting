❌ Before Working With Us – Key Challenges:

Manual Outreach With No Consistency:
Delano was trying to handle his LinkedIn and social media outreach himself, but due to client work and production responsibilities, he couldn't give it consistent time and attention.

Inconsistent Lead Flow:
Despite offering a premium, high-trust service, his outreach wasn’t yielding qualified leads regularly—impacting his business growth and visibility.

Lack of Systemized Follow-Up:
No clear outreach structure or system meant warm leads often went cold without any follow-up or next steps.
